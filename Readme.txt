By Jia Li and M. Rosemary Pang

The original name for "Wave1.csv" is "COVID_survey_0918-2.csv". This wave of survey was conducted in Summer 2020 (August/September) in a public university in the U.S. We received 506 responses. 139 responses are incomplete which leaves us a sample size of 367 subjects. After dropping incomplete survey responses, we have 92 observations in the control group, 92 observations in the positive group, 93 observations, in the negative group, and 90 observations in the additive group. 

The original name for "Wave2.csv" is "COVID_survey_wave2_0809_2.csv". This wave of survey was conducted from late March to late July 2021 across the U.S. We received 1658 responses nationwide. 856 responses are incomplete, 21 responses who completed the survey have never been to the United States due to travel restrictions during the pandemic, which leaves us a sample size of 781 in the second wave. After dropping incomplete survey responses, we have 194 observations in the control group, 196 observations in the positive group, 195 observations, in the negative group, and 196 observations in the additive group.
